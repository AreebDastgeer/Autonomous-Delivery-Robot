# Autonomous Delivery Robot

This project focuses on developing an autonomous delivery robot designed to navigate through urban environments to deliver online grocery orders safely and efficiently. The robot is capable of detecting and avoiding obstacles such as buildings, houses, and vehicles on roads, ensuring secure and timely deliveries to designated locations.

## Brief Explanation

### Color Codes
- **ROBOT:** Turquoise
- **DELIVERY POINTS:** Red
- **CAR:** Orange
- **BUILDINGS:** Gray
- **TREES:** Dark Green
- **HOUSE:** Brown

Using A* Search, our autonomous delivery robot navigates through an urban environment to deliver packages to designated locations while avoiding obstacles. A* Search is preferred over Best-First Search for this scenario as it guarantees optimality and efficiency by combining actual and estimated costs, ensuring complete and reliable navigation.

## Key Features
- **Obstacle Detection and Avoidance:** Utilizes algorithms to identify and navigate around obstacles in real-time.                    
- **Path Planning:** Implements advanced pathfinding techniques to determine the most efficient routes to delivery destinations.
